# Information
*"It's time Keeper. Wait... You don't remember do you? Let me fill you in on the little itty gritty details. Hmmm. Let's start off with the fact that you were banished..."*

Evil is Good is a clone of the game *Dungeon Keeper* that works on modern hardware, open-source, and has similar mechanics to the original. You play as an Evil Keeper with a job. To destroy and conquer the land! You defeat these so called "Heroes" and other Keepers trying to take over the land. You also find interesting trinkets and learn more about your Evil as you go on. It is Good to be Evil, isn't it Keeper?

This game is currently not in a playable state. Please wait a while or contribute to the project if you wish to play.
